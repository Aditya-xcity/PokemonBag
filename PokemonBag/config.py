# This file is intentionally kept minimal and serves as a centralized
# location for Flask and application-level configuration variables.
#
# Configuration such as environment settings, debug flags,
# secret keys, database connections, or future feature toggles
# can be defined here and loaded into the Flask app.
#
# Keeping this file separate helps maintain clean architecture
# and allows easy scaling without modifying core application code.
